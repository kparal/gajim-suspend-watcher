Fix for `Gajim IM <http://gajim.org/>`_ to disconnect accounts before machine suspend and reconnect them after machine resume.

This was written for GNOME, but it could work also for other environments with UPower and NetworkManager.

Note: Gajim 0.15+ now correctly disconnects accounts before suspend, but it does not still auto-reconnect after resume, so this script is still needed.


Usage
=====

See ``$ ./gajim-suspend-watcher.py --help``.

Auto-start this script on your login (``~/.config/autostart``).
